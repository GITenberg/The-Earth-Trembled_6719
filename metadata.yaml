description: At the beginning of the Civil War there was a fine old residence on meeting
  street in Charleston, South Carolina, inhabited by a family almost as old as the
  state. Its inheritor and owner, Orville Burgoyne, was a widower. He had been much
  saddened in temperament since the death of the wife, and had withdrawn as far as
  possible from public affairs. His library and the past had secured a stronger hold
  upon his interest and his thoughts than anything in the present, with one exception,
  his idolized and only child, Mary, named for her deceased mother.
